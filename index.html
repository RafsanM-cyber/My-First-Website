   <div class="hobby">
       <ul>
        <li>Video Games - I always loved video games to this day, video games made a lot of my childhood. Only thing is I only played mobile games my whole life(ik, sad life, but I still enjoyed it a lot)</li>
        <li>Soccer - Soccer wasn't much of a hobby of me as a kid. Growing up it became a hobby as I started to play a lot more of the sport. I played Centre-back and sometimes goalie(Since almost no one wants to play goalie ofc) </li>
        <li>Reading - Ik, it sounds boring to read, for me it was the same, until recently. I decided to open a book and ACTUALLY read the book after 7 years(or more, if any English Teacher heard this they would prolly expel me) and I enjoyed it a lot. The genres I like the most are Non-Fiction and Classics. </li>
        <li>Journaling - I also hated writing as a kid. It was also the only thing I was bad at. During my freshman year I started to work on my writing after frequent complains from my teacher, and my writing became better(more confusing). At the end of freshman year I actually started to get my writing better and it has helped a lot on my journaling. I decided to journal all of a sudden since being a programmer you are restricted from touching grass, so just bragging about my day on my journal sometimes really brought me a lot of joy.</li>

    <div class="Yes">
        <ul>
            <li>New York - In NY I went to various places. The city(obivously) and Upstate New York. I tend to enjoy Upstate New York more than the city as it's more peaceful and I can admire nature(pretty rare now that I program)</li>
            <li>Washington DC - This was the first time I went to Washington DC. Some areas I visited are The White House, Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, and The Capitol Building. My recommendations are to visit it in the evening as the sunset in DC just looks spectacular. </li>
            <li>Canada - I went to Canada a few times, mostly in my childhood, so I am pretty used to the area itself. Some places I visited are Niagara Falls, and more places(I actually forgot a lot of the places, cuz the last time I went was like 8 years ago)</li>
            <li> Bangladesh - My parents are from Bangladesh, so visitng my parents home country is something special for me. In Bangladesh lifestyle is completely different from the West. In Bangladesh, lifestyle is more around visitng family and looking out for one another.(One family in Bangladesh has like hundreds of people, Ik, pretty bizzare for people in the US. In fact, I don't even know the first 100 people in my family.) On a serious note I really enjoy Bangladesh since there is so many fun stuff to do.</li>

<div class="Ambition">
      <ul>
        <li>Computer Science - In my future, I'd like to pursue computer science and become rich(like any person would dream of)</li>
        <li>Money - Yes, money, ofc anyone would want to become a millionare, and so do I.</li>
        <li>Community - I can't just hold a ton of money and sit like a duck, I have to use it the right way. One way I can acheive this is through donating to charity and fund under-represented communities so they can use it to educate their kids. I'd also like to advocate for under-represented communities and have their kids have a chance to break into STEM and have the oppurtunity to pursue a career in STEM</li>
        <li>Buisness/Startup - I am still undecided to whether to start a buinsess or start-up, that decision is for me more into the future. What I can assure is right now I'd like to do something related to tech</li>
